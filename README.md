Generate Alchemical LAMMPS Inputs
==============================

Functions to generate LAMMPS inputs for alchemical calculations. This package was produced for generating the simulation input file for the completion of the publication "Hydration Contribution to the Solvation Free Energy of Water-Soluble Polymers". These functions include inputs used for thermodynamic integration, Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR), or Multi-state Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR).

## Documentation

 - locally: Run the following in the command line: ``python -m generate_alchemical_lammps_inputs -d``
 - Online: [NIST Pages][docs4nist]

## Dependencies

This package is tested for python 3.10+ on all Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems.
No python library dependencies are required before installation.

## Installation

* Step 1: Download the master branch from our github page as a zip file, or clone it to your working directory with:

    ``git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/generate_alchemical_lammps_inputs``

* Step 2 (Optional): If you are using conda and you want to create a new environment for this package you may install with:

    ``conda env create -f generate_alchemical_lammps_inputs/requirements.yaml``

* Step 3: Install package with:

    ``pip install generate_alchemical_lammps_inputs/.``

    or change directories and run

    ``pip install .``

    Adding the flag ``-e`` will allow you to make changes that will be functional without reinstallation.

* Step 4: Initialize pre-commits (for developers)

    ``pre-commit install``
